DataPLANT has been informed that the Joint Science Conference (GWK) has followed the recommendation of the NFDI Expert Panel and today decided to support the [NFDI 7/1 DataPLANT] proposal ([press release of the GWK](https://www.gwk-bonn.de/fileadmin/Redaktion/Dokumente/Pressemitteilungen/pm2020-04.pdf)). Furthermore, it was informed that the GWK has not yet made a final decision on the amount of funding to be granted per consortium. This decision will be taken on the basis of a consultation of the NFDI expert panel, which will take place on 9 July. An official notification from the University of Freiburg as consortium leader in DataPLANT is [also available](https://www.pr.uni-freiburg.de/pm/2020/pflanzliches-leben-besser-verstehen). In parallel to the ongoing planning for the project kick-off, DataPLANT has entered into coordination with the NFDI directorate and exchange with the other funded consortia on consortium agreement, recruitment and cross-cutting topics. Further on DataPLANT participates in the joint NFDI workshop on meta data.
