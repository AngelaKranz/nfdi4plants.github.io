ARCs are a profile implementation of RO-Crates for basic plant research.

The ARC is packaged with its digital object identifier and its RO Metadata File (ro-crate-metadata.json).

This RO metadata file is automatically generated using a converter, which is able to read and transport information out of the ARC.
