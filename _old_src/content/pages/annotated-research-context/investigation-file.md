A mandatory central registry for studies, assays, persons, â€¦ is saved as XLSX format, which follows the ISA model specification (v1.0). 

Using the ARC Commander allows you to automatically fill and update the investigation file.

Every worksheet needs to contain one table object storing the metadata.  Comments or additional information can be stored alongside with table objects in a worksheet.
