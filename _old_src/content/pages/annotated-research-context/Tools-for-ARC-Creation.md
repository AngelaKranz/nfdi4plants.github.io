Although ARCs can be generated completely manually, we encourage you to use our convenient tools that assist you in the process.  
The [ARC Commander](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arcCommander "Arc Commander") offers machine-aided creation and completion of the ARC folder and file structure.

[Swate](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swate "Swate") and our templates assists you in the process of creating your assay files.
