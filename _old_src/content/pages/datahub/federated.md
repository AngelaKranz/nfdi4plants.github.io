[The DataHUB (federated)](https://gitlab.nfdi4plants.de/explore) is an implementation of the DataHUB concept hosted at the University of TÃ¼bingen. The DataHUB runs on a federated infrastructure that relies on fail-over strategies to ensure that the service is always available, even when hardware or network failures occur. This DataHUB can be accessed with your home institution credentials through the [Life Science Research Infrastructure](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login.html) or by using another identity provider, like ORCID.
