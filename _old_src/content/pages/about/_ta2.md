DataPLANT and the plant research community can draw on extensive infrastructural capacities for compute and storage, such as the de.NBI Cloud in Tübingen and Freiburg and the bwCloud, amongst others. Task Area II will provide the infrastructural basis for the developed tools. For this, the DataPLANT Hub, based on HUBZero, will serve as the central access point. 
Wherever possible, a single sign-on concept will be used for user-friendliness. Furthermore, a service to facilitate data and metadata versioning, collaboration among researchers, and data sharing within ongoing projects will be set up. To support researchers in publishing their work, a service based on InvenioRDM is established. Unique identification will be accomplished using Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and ORCID.
