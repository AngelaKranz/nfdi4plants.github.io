In Task Area I, topics such as data quality, interoperability and standardization are promoted. Besides the definition of metadata standards, the application of widely used ontologies, such as the Gene-, KEGG-, and Plant Ontology, and will be supported in a first step. These existing ontologies will then be iteratively adapted to the needs of researchers and their specific experiments in order to comprehensively describe workflows. 

The often-long path from the identification of a missing term to the final adoption into the descriptive reference ontology will be significantly shortened with minimal friction. A first approach to achieve this is pursued by DataPLANTâ€™s developed tool [Swate](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/Swate).
