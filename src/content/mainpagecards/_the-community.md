DataPLANT is primarily geared towards the needs of fundamental plant research (e.g. those represented by the DFG categories 2.12-[01 evolution and systematics of plants and fungi, 04 plant physiology, 05 plant biochemistry and biophysics, 06 plant cell and developmental biology, 07 plant genetics and genomics]). As such DataPLANT is especially adapted to large scale data sets, be it omics science or imaging, and is ready to store petabaytes of annotated data.
