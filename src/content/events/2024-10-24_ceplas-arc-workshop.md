## Goals

- First steps into the ARC ecosystem
- Move existing datasets into <a href="https://arc-rdm.org/" target="_blank">ARCs</a>
- Share them via the <a href="https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCitect-Manual/index.html" target="_blank">DataHUB</a>
- Annotate them with metadata

## Checklist for participants

Please prepare the following **before the workshop**.

- Bring your laptop / computer
- Bring a dataset to be ARCified
- Sign up for a DataHUB user account https://register.nfdi4plants.org/
  - Please add your `Project/consortium` (e.g. CEPLAS, SFB, TRR) and choose the role `Guest` or `User`
- Install <a href="https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCitect-Manual/index.html" target="_blank">ARCitect</a>

## Tech-check

Not all installations are perfectly straight-forward. We will be available **half an hour before the workshop starts** to help you get your machine up and running.

## Continuous support  

FAIR data experts from Düsseldorf, Cologne, Jülich and close by (CEPLAS, MibiNet, TRR341) offer *ad hoc* support, see [details here](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/teaching-materials/disseminations/ARC-user-support_HHU-Uoc-FZJ/arc-user-support.html).
