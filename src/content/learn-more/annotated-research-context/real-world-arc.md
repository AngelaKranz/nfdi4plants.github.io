<span style="color:lightblue-darker-10">An ARC is intended to capture complete (meta)data, including raw and processed data, but also workflow descriptions as well as essential external files. ARCs cover scenarios ranging from single experimental setups to complex experimental designs. The full ARC-specifications are provided [here](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specfication "ARC-specification").</span>
