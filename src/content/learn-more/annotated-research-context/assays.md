Each assay is a collection of files stored in a single directory, including a mandatory metadata file in ISA-XLSX format.

Assay data files as well as protocols must be placed in a subdirectory individually. 

We advise you to use SWATE for completing the metadata files, as it comes along with a broad range of prepared templates and as it assists you in following the [annotation principles](http://www.nfdi4plants.de/AnnotationPrinciples/ "Annotation Principles").
