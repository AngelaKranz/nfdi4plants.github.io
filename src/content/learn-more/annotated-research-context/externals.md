External data or knowledge files refer to data that is neither originating within the investigation/study scope of the ARC nor can be referenced externally. Yet, these files are required to ensure reproducibility. Examples include early use of ontologies, mapping files, gene information, and so on. All corresponding files need to be stored in the ARCâ€™s top-level externals directory.

Together these external data form a virtual assay. To follow the metadata requirements of assays, a metadata file in ISA-XLSX format is mandatory for each external file, located under the top-level externals directory.
