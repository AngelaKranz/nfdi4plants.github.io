summary: The ARC is DataPLANT's FAIR Digital Object of choice.

The importance of RDM systems continues to grow as scientists and institutions increasingly generate large, diverse datasets. 
In line with the FAIR principles, such data should be stored in open, public archives using standardized, non-proprietary formats to ensure accessibility and reusability. 
DataPLANTâ€™s ARC provides an RDM platform designed to meet these needs while supporting machine-readability, as it is built entirely on established standards. 
Each ARC is assigned a persistent, unique identifier and contains in a standardized and encapsulated way not only raw data but also all associated information required to reproduce the research, including metadata, external files, and computational code. 
ARCs can represent anything from a single publication to large-scale, multi-lab, long-term projects. 
As FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs), ARCs play a crucial role in advancing the FAIRification of research data, particularly in fundamental plant research.
