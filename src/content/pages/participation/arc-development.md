ARCs are designed to represent FAIR Digital Objects (FDOs) for plant sciences to facilitate encompassing Research Data Management (RDM) tasks.
By following the ARC guidelines, scientists will package their research data with metadata in a way that will follow the FAIR principles, ISA standard and RO Crate standard.
When using the DataPLANT tools (e.g. [ARCitect](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/docs/ARCitect-Manual/index.html]) and [guides](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/index.html) to create ARCs, the majority of ARC guidelines will be followed automatically.
The detailed description of these technical requirements are captured in the ARC specification, that can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specification?tab=readme-ov-file).
The main purpose of these ARC specifications is to benefit the scientist by supporting them in FAIR research data management that follows standards of the scientific community. As such, any feedback or contributions from the community are welcome.
You can provide suggestions via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specification/issues) or contribute to the discussion of novel conceptual ideas [here](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/ARC-specification/discussions).
