The importance of RDM systems is growing as scientists and institutions generate increasingly large and diverse datasets. 
According to FAIR principles, such data should be stored in open, public archives using standardized, non-proprietary formats for better accessibility and reuse. 
DataPLANT's Annotated Research Context (ARC) framework meets these needs by supporting machine-readability and adhering to established standards. 
Each ARC is assigned a unique identifier and encapsulates not only raw data but also all information necessary to reproduce the research, including metadata, external files, and code. 
ARCs, which can represent anything from single publications to large multi-lab projects, are key to advancing the FAIRification of research data, especially in fundamental plant research.
