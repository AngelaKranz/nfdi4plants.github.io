In the future, the collection of ARCs will be available in a searchable form. Based on specific data or metadata attributes, each scientist will have quick access to individual measurements, information or entire ARCs. The searchability of a single factor in different plants, experiments or under different conditions thus leads to the opening of “a whole new world” (*Aladdin*).
