The DataHUBs of DataPLANT serve as central repositories where research data and associated metadata are stored in the form of Annotated Research Contexts (ARCs). Built on GitLab, all DataHUBs offer robust version control features, allowing users full authority over access and interaction with their research data. Each DataHUB implementation includes backup strategies to ensure the stored data is safeguarded. 

DataPLANT offers two primary DataHUB nodes: the DataHUB (reference) and the DataHUB (federated), both accessible to the entire plant science community. Additionally, there are on-premise implementations designed for specific sub-communities. All DataHUBs are equipped with backup and sustainability measures to ensure data safety and long-term availability. 

We recommend selecting a DataHUB implementationsite before creating your first ARC and maintaining all ARCs within a single DataHUB. For more information about DataHUB features and how to interact with them, please visit our Knowledge Base. 

List of DataHUBs: 

| DataHUB Futher | Information |
| --- | --- |
| DataHUB (reference)| The DataHUB (reference) is hosted at the University of Freiburg. To gain access to this DataHUB, you can either create an account on the sign-up page, or login through your home institution or another identity provider like ORCID, Google, or Apple. To secure your data, the DataHUB Node Freiburg makes use of backup and resilience strategies provided through the backend. | 
| DataHUB (federated) | The DataHUB (federated) is an implementation of the DataHUB concept hosted at the University of Tübingen. The DataHUB runs on a federated infrastructure that relies on fail-over strategies to ensure that the service is always available, even when hardware or network failures occur. This DataHUB can be accessed with your home institution credentials through the [Life Science Research Infrastructure](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login.html) or by using another identity provider, like ORCID. | 
| TRR356 (PlantMicrobe) | The TRR356 (PlantMicrobe) is a DataHUB implementationsite specific for the transregional collaboration project PlantMicrobe and is hosted at the University of Tübingen and the LMU in Munich. Only members of the project TRR356 PlantMicrobe have access to this DataHUB and can publish data there. Like the nfdi4plants.de DataHUB, the PlantMicrobe DataHUB runs on a federated infrastructure that relies on fail-over strategies to ensure the availability of the service.|
