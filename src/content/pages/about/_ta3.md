Task Area III takes care of the continuous community contact and direct personnel support of the individual research groups during their everyday data management tasks. This is accomplished through Data Stewards as a core element of the DataPLANT research data management strategy to bridge the gap between technical solutions, infrastructure, and researchers. 

By providing advice in data and workflow management, they promote the process of standardizing metadata, the use of ontologies and data provenance. Through direct on-site interaction, they can immediately respond immediately to the requirements and needs of researchers.
Training of these Data Stewards also belongs to the responsibility of Task Area III.
