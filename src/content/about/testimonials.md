With a diverse research landscape across four institutions, CEPLAS demands a robust, sustainable data management system. ARC and the DataHUB provide a flexible, adaptable environment for managing and annotating diverse data types, enabling seamless collaboration across institutions and ensuring structured, controlled data exchange both within CEPLAS and with external partners. This empowers us to collaborate efficiently from data acquisition through integration with internationally recognized systems."
