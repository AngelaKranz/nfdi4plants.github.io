Task Area IV is responsible for the communication within the project, as well as integration with the overall NFDI and promotion of common efforts. 
A central task is the extension to all researchers in the field of fundamental plant research. Only in this way the consortium can credibly represent the research area and establish common standards and concepts. Thus, DataPLANT immediately aimed for close cooperation and coordination and could already accomplish a close connection with the INF-Project SFB TRR175  and the Data Stewards of CEPLAS.
A certain provision of support by data stewards, advice on application and legal issues, and infrastructure is intended for researchers who join the project later on.
