The ARCSearch is a tool for integrated search and analysis of individual ARCs and experimental metadata. 
The web-based user interface provides a consolidated real-time view of the public ARCs within the DataPLANT community. 
The search functions of the ARC Registry application enable users to explore the ARCs and the assay/measurement data. 
The users can look up the ARCs by specific keywords, such as the working group they are interested in or by a particular data steward from the group. 
Most importantly, the users can also search and explore the experimental metadata from various ARCs simultaneously, thus, paving the way toward crossomics metadata exploration within the community.
