The annotation of metadata is essential for well-maintained research data according to FAIR principles. 
The completeness of these metadata can depend on the corresponding endpoint repository and is based on specific formats, checklists and terminologies. 
For individual researchers, the number of different standards and checklists can easily become unmanageable. 

Therefore, we have made it our mission to keep track of the key metadata relevant for data publication by including them in templates that can be integrated into ARCs easily, enabling the individual researcher to comfortably use the prefabricated construct. 

Swate (Swate workflow annotation tool for Excel) simplifies adding standardized metadata for your experimental workflows by leveraging a simple use of ontologies. 
Swate is integrated into ARCitect and will automatically be used when adding metadata to your studies and assays from within ARCitect, but it can also be used as a standalone tool in Excel and in your browser.
