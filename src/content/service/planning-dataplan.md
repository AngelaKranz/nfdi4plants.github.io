The DMP Generator of DataPLAN is an innovative tool designed to streamline the creation of Data DMPs, a key component in ensuring that research data is handled according to best practices throughout its lifecycle. 
Tailored to the needs of researchers in plant science, the DMP Generator provides a user-friendly interface that guides scientists through the process of creating comprehensive, FAIR-compliant DMPs. 

By integrating established standards and protocols, DataPLAN ensures that essential aspects such as data collection, storage, sharing, and long-term preservation are fully addressed. 

Researchers are prompted to detail how their data will be documented, how it will be made accessible for future use, and what measures will be taken to safeguard its integrity and security. 

It also supports customization for specific projects, allowing users to create plans that fit both small-scale studies and large, collaborative research efforts. 
Furthermore, the tool provides templates that align with funding agency requirements, making it easier for researchers to meet compliance obligations.
