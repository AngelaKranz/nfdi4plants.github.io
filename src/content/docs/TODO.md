# TODOs

## web components (Issues Kevin)

- de-couple knowledgebase from static page
- structure content, e.g.
  - docs
  - training
  - tutorial

- create layout `landing`
  - no date / published
  - no author, etc. (do not parse)
  - MAY contain TOC
  - MAY contain sidebar

- yaml header: change "published" to "date"
  - things may be created, but not visibly published




## How to

- author (new) content
- edit / suggest changes to existing content
  - pull request
  - assign article author to review changes
  - yaml key: github username
- test before push

## github mechanisms

- pull request template

## others

- commenting in documents
  - public, but not visible
- "public" vs. visible
