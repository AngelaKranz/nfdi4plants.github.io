The ARCSearch is a tool for integrated search and analysis of individual ARCs and experimental metadata.

It is hosted by DataPLANT and aggregates ARCs across all federated ARC Data Hub instances, including the [PLANTdataHUB](#plant-data-hub).

It is available at https://arcregistry.nfdi4plants.org/isasearch.

The web-based user interface provides a consolidated real-time view of the public ARCs within the DataPLANT community.
