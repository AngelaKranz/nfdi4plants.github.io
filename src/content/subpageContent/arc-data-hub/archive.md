A data publication repository for ARCs with integrated DOI minting.

It is available here: https://archive.nfdi4plants.org/communities/dataplant

The ARChive is connected via QCQ pipelines that ensure that an ARC meets certain criteria.
A service called [ARChigator]() is then used to submit the ARC to the ARChive upon user request.
