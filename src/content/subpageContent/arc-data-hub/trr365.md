[The TRR356 (PlantMicrobe)](https://trr356plantmicrobe.de/for-members-only--gitlab/index.html) is an ARC Data Hub implementation specific for the transregional collaboration project PlantMicrobe and is hosted at the University of TÃ¼bingen and the LMU in Munich.
Only members of the project TRR356 PlantMicrobe have access to this DataHUB and can publish data there.
Like the nfdi4plants.de DataHUB, the PlantMicrobe DataHUB runs on a federated infrastructure that relies on fail-over strategies to ensure the availability of the service.
