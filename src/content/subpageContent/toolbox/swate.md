Swate provides a familiar, spreadsheet-like work environment that makes it easy to incrementally increase metadata quality of an [ARC Scaffold](https://arc-rdm.org/details/arc-representation/#arc-scaffold).
Swate is integrated into the [ARCitect](#arcitect), but can also be used as a [standalone-web based tool](https://swate-alpha.nfdi4plants.org/).
