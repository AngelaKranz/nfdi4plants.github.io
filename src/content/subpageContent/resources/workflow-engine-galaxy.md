The Galaxy workflow system enables you to analyze data from your ARCs by running tools and datasets in a defined sequence, streamlining repetitive tasks and ensuring consistency.

You can easily create workflows from your analysis history or design new ones using the intuitive editor.
Galaxy workflows are flexible and fully customizable, allowing you to annotate steps, share with colleagues, and publish for the community.
Workflows are treated as core objects, just like datasets, and can be modified to fit your specific needs.
Whether for routine tasks or complex analyses, Galaxy provides a powerful platform for automating and managing your workflows efficiently.
