DataPLANT is committed to developing a Research Data Management (RDM) system that meets community requirements and facilitates the processing and contextualization of research datasets in accordance with the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
To achieve this, we introduce the Annotated Research Context (ARC), which supports the entire research cycleâ€”from experiments to computational analyses, encompassing both actual data and metadata, as well as the resulting publications.
This approach ensures practical usability and will contribute to the creation of a central information resource.
